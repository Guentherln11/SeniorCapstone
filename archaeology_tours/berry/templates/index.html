        <div class = berryIntro>
            <p>Located in Morganton, Burke County, the Berry Site
            is identified as the Native American town of Joara,
            occupied from around AD 1400 through 1600. The people
            of the western Piedmont region of North Carolina lived
            here for 12,000 years. The broad floodplain of the area
            on which the Berry Site sits was also lived on for
            thousands of years, with evidence of pottery and
            projectile points.</p>
            <p>It is also the site for a 16th century Spanish
            colonial outpost. It was established in 1567 by
            Captain Juan Pardo and his army, making it the
             first European settlement in the interior of what
            is now the United States. The Spanish town was
            called Cuenca, and a fort was built known as Fort
            San Juan. This outpost was part of an effort to
            establish a permanent route of colonial outposts
            along However, as the result of rising tensions
            between the Natives of Joara and the Spanish
            explorers, the settlement only lasted until June of
            1568, when it was burned and destroyed.</p>
